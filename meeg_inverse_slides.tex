%% Notes:

% Santiago Ramon y Cajal is considered by many the father of modern neuroscience. 
% His great contribution was to provide definitive evidence for what later would
% be known as the "neuron theory". The neuron theory is really is the beginning
% of what we all know as neuroscience. Before Cajal, the central nervous system 
% was thought to be a web of continuous elements without any functional specialization.
%
% The great success of Cajal was due to his unique technical skills. To all 
% practical effects he had the best anatomical scanning technology of the time. 
% He improved a staining technology developed by Camillo Golgi which allowed him
% to draw pictures of the central nervous system with an unprecedented level of
% detail. 
%
% Cajal's anatomical studies were always presented in a functional context (Llinás, 
% 2003). One of his most insightful hypotheses was that neurons were functionally
% polarized, that is, electrical impulses propagate from dendrites to the cell body to
% the axon. He rightly saw neurons as information processing units that make connections
% and organize into dynamic networks to accomplish their various functions. The neuron
% doctrine constitutes the basis for our understanding of the organization of the nervous
% system, giving Cajal, its main architect, the stature of scientists such as Galileo,
% Newton and Darwin (Shepherd, 1991). 

% This drawing by Santiago Ramon y Cajal first appeared in volume two, part two of 
% Cajal's Textura del Sistema Nervioso del Hombre y de los Vertebrados, published in Madrid
% in 1904. The image shows the six layers of the mouse neocortex, labeled A through F, in
% Cajal's hand. Cajal's drawings provided the foundation of modern neuroanatomy by
% showing that the nervous system is composed of individual nerve cells, as opposed to a
% web of continuous elements.

'' [technique is] so important that [...] it may be stated that great discoveries are in the hands of the finest and most knowledgeable experts on one or more of the analytical methods'' (Cajal, 1899; p65).

%
% On the right a parcellation scheme for human left lateral parietal cortex
%
% The parietal lobe has long been viewed as a collection of architectonic and functional
% subdivisions. Though much parietal research has focused on mechanisms of visuospatial
% attention and control-related processes, more recent functional neuroimaging studies 
% of memory retrieval have reported greater activity in left lateral parietal cortex
% (LLPC) when items are correctly identified as previously studied (“old”) versus
% unstudied (“new”). These studies have suggested functional divisions within LLPC that
% may provide distinct contributions toward recognition memory judgments. Here, we define
% regions within LLPC by developing a parcellation scheme that integrates data from
% resting-state functional connectivity MRI and functional MRI. This combined approach
% results in a 6-fold parcellation of LLPC based on the presence (or absence) of
% memory-retrieval-related activity, dissociations in the profile of task-evoked time
% courses, and membership in large-scale brain networks. This parcellation should serve
% as a roadmap for  future investigations aimed at understanding LLPC function.

% NOTES (from http://www.bris.ac.uk/synaptic/basics/): 

% Neurons pump out positively charged sodium ions. In addition, they pump in
% positively charged potassium ions. Thus there is a high concentration of
% sodium ions present outside the neuron, and a high concentration of potassium
% ions inside. The neuronal membrane also contains specialised proteins called 
% channels, which form pores in the membrane that are selectively permeable to 
% particular ions. Thus sodium channels allow sodium ions through the membrane 
% while potassium channels allow potassium ions through.

% Under resting conditions, the potassium channel is more permeable to potassium
% ions than the sodium channel is to sodium ions. So there is a slow outward leak
% of potassium ions that is larger than the inward leak of sodium ions. This 
% means that the membrane has a charge on the inside face that is negative 
% relative to the outside, as more positively charged ions flow out of the neuron
% than flow in. This difference in the concentrations of ions on either side of 
% the membrane gives rise to the membrane potential and the membrane is said to be
% polarised. 

% However, if the sodium channels are opened, positively charged sodium ions flood
% into the neuron, and making the inside of the cell momentarily positively 
% charged - the cell is said to be depolarized. This has the effect of opening the
% potassium channels, allowing potassium ions to leave the cell. Thus, there is 
% first an influx of sodium ions (leading to massive depolarization) followed by 
% a rapid efflux of potassium ions from the neuron (leading to repolarisation). 
% Excess ions are subsequently pumped in/out of the neuron. 

% Neurons communicate at structures called synapses in a process called synaptic
% transmission. The synapse consists of the two neurons, one of which is sending
% information to the other. The sending neuron is known as the pre-synaptic neuron
% (i.e. before the synapse) while the receiving neuron is known as the 
% post-synaptic neuron (i.e. after the synapse). Although the flow of information
% around the brain is achieved by electrical activity, communication between 
% neurons is a chemical process. When an action potential reaches a synapse, pores
% in the cell membrane are opened allowing an influx of calcium ions (positively
% charged calcium atoms) into the pre-synaptic terminal. This causes a small 
% 'packet' of a chemical neurotransmitter to be released into a small gap between 
% the two cells, known as the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter diffuses across
% the synaptic cleft and interacts with specialized proteins called receptors that
% are embedded in the post-synaptic membrane. These receptors are ion channels that
% allow certain types of ions (charged atoms) to pass through a pore within their
% structure. The pore is opened following interaction with the neurotransmitter 
% allowing an influx of ions into the post-synaptic terminal, which is propagated
% along the dendrite towards the soma.

\frame{\frametitle{M/EEG generation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \small Synchronously activated large pyramidal 
cortical neurons are believed to be the main MEG/EEG generators
\vspace{.2cm}
\item \small A synchronous cortical patch 5mm x 5mm 
would probably yield enough net current to be measurable at the scalp
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{./img/eegmeg-generation.png}
\end{center}
}

% NOTES: 
%
% Macrocolumns of tens of thousands of neurons.
%
% The main reason is that such cortical columns have large dendritic trunks
% locally oriented in parallel and pointing perpendicularly to the cortical
% surface. 
%
% The currents associated with the EPSPs generated among their dendrites are 
% believed to be at the source of most of the signals detected in MEG and EEG
% because they typically last longer (up to 100 ms) than the rapidly firing 
% action potentials (2ms) traveling along the axons of excited neurons.
%
% Some approximate calculations suggest that what we are seeing with EEG/MEG
% is the cumulative summation of millions of synaptic juntions in a relatively
% small region
%
% Nominal calculations of neuronal density and cortical thickness suggest that
% the cortex has a macrocellular current density on the order of 100nA/mm2
% If we assume the cortex is about 4 mm thick, then a small patch 5x5mm would
% yield the necessary current to be measurable at the scalp

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEMS WITH SPHERICAL HEAD MODELS

\frame{\frametitle{Problems with spherical head models}

\item Sensor-weighted models with multiple spheres complicate things (too much)

% By its very shape, the spherical model distorts the true distribution of passive currents in the
% brain, skull and scalp. Spherical models also require that the sensor positions be projected onto
% the fitted sphere (figure 1) resulting in a distortion of the true sensorÐdipole spatial geometry
% and ultimately the computed surface potential. The use of a single best-fitted multilayer sphere
% has the added drawback of incomplete coverage of the inner skull region, often ignoring areas
% such as the frontal cortex. In practice, this problem is typically resolved by fitting additional
% spheres to those regions not covered by the primary sphere. The use of these additional
% spheres results in added complication in the EEG forward model, since a neural source may
% be simultaneously inside of some spheres and outside others.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FEW EQUATIONS


\frame{\frametitle{Few equations}

An elementary current dipole $\vec{q}$ is fully defined by its location ($\vec{r}_q$), its magnitude (a scalar $m$) and its orientation ($\Theta=\left\{\theta,\phi\right\}$). \\
\vspace{.3cm}
The  electric potential generated by such elementary dipole at a scalp location $\vec{r}$ is given by:

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{.6\textwidth}
\[
v(\vec{r}) = a(\vec{r},\vec{r}_q,\Theta)m
\]
\hspace{.3cm} where $a$ is a \alert{gain coefficient}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{.4\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{./img/dipole-formulas.png}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
	

}


\frame{\frametitle{Few equations}

Recall the formula of the potential generated by a dipole:
\vspace{.2cm}
\begin{center}
\boxed{
v(\vec{r}) = a(\vec{r},\vec{r}_q,\Theta)m
}
\end{center}

Generalizing the equation to $R$ dipoles and $K$ sensors is trivial:

\[
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
v_1\\
v_2\\
\vdots\\
v_K\\ 
\end{array}
\right]
= 
\underbrace{
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1R}\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
a_{K1} & \cdots & a_{KR}\\
\end{array}
\right]}_{\textrm{leadfield matrix: } \A}
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
m_1\\
\vdots\\
m_R\\
\end{array}
\right]
\]



}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EQUIVALENT CURRENT DIPOLES

\frame{\frametitle{Equivalent Current Dipoles (ECD)}

The ECD approach simply tries to minimize the following least-squares contrast:

\[
J_{LS}\left(\{\r_{qi},\Theta_i\},\m \right) = \left\|\v-\A(\{\r_{qi},\Theta_i\})\m\right\|^2
\]

which is equivalent to:
\vspace{.2cm}
\begin{center}
\boxed{
J_{LS}\left(\{\r_{qi},\Theta_i\} \right) = \left\|\v-\A\A^+\v\right\|^2
}
\end{center}

Problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of dipoles has to be fixed a priori
\item A nonlinear (multivariate) optimization problem
\item Nonconvexity increases rapidly with the number of dipoles
\end{itemize}

	

}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DISTRIBUTED APPROACHES


\frame{\frametitle{Distributed techniques: aka Imaging approaches}

\begin{itemize}	
\item Determining the dipoles' location/orientation is difficult
	
\vspace{.2cm}
	
\item Once done that, estimating dipole amplitudes is easy
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}	
	
So...
	
\vspace{.5cm}
	
\begin{itemize}	
\item Let's place dipoles everywhere in the brain
	
\vspace{.2cm}
	
\item Let's then estimate the dipole amplitudes
	
\vspace{.2cm}
	
\item A close-to-zero amplitude would then mean the absence of a dipole at the corresponding location
\end{itemize}
	
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DEFINING THE SOURCE SPACE


\frame{\frametitle{Defining the source space}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Obviously, we cannot put dipoles just ''everywhere'', but we have to choose a discrete number of spatial locations: the \alert{source space} 
	\vspace{.2cm}
	\item Ideally, the source space should be based on anatomical constraints
	\vspace{.2cm}
	\item But we could also just sample uniformly the whole brain volume
	\end{itemize}
	

}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FORMULATING THE INVERSE PROBLEM


\frame{\frametitle{Formulating the inverse problem}

For distributed approaches, we have that:

\[
\v = \A\m
\]

where $\v=[v_1, ..., v_K]^T$ are the potentials measured at $K$ scalp locations, $\A$ is a $KxR$ leadfield matrix, and $\m=[m_1, \cdots, m_R]^T$ are the magnitudes of the $R>>K$ dipoles contained in the source space.

\vspace{.2cm}

The goal now is  to minimize the contrast:

\[
J(\m) = \left\|\v-\A\m\right\|^2
\]	

\vspace{1cm}

\tiny{Note: $\left\|\z\right\|^2$ is the squared $l^2$ norm of vector $\z = [z_1, ..., z_K]$, which is defined as $\left\|\z\right\|^2 = \z_1^2+...+\z_K^2$}

}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DISADVANTAGES OF DISTRIBUTED APPROACHES


\frame{\frametitle{Disadvantages of distributed approaches}

\begin{itemize}
\item A heavily underdetermined inverse problem
\vspace{.3cm}
\item How to define the source space?
\vspace{.3cm}
\item How to define the boundaries between differentiated sources?
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SOLUTION TO THE DISTRIBUTED INVERSE PROBLEM


\frame{\frametitle{Solution to the distributed inverse problem}

The minimum of the contrast that we showed in the previous slide is:

\[
\hat{\m}=\W\W^T\A^T\left(\A\W\W^T\A^T+\lambda\I\right)^{-1}\v
\]

where:

\vspace{.2cm}

$\A$ is the leadfield matrix

\vspace{.2cm}

$\W$ encodes a-priori information on the inverse solution

\vspace{.2cm}

$\lambda$ is a regularization parameter  
	

}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MINIMUM NORM ESTIMATE (MNE)


\frame{\frametitle{Minimum Norm Estimate (MNE)}

The MNE solution does not use a-priori information, so that the solution becomes:

\[
\hat{\m}=\A^T\left(\A\A^T+\lambda\I\right)^{-1}\v
\]


\begin{itemize}
\item The simplest solution
\vspace{.1cm}
\item Produces a solution $\hat{\m}$ of minimum norm 
\vspace{.1cm}
\item It favours superficial dipoles versus deeper ones, as the latter would require higher energies (i.e. norms) to account for the same amount of observed data variance
\vspace{.1cm}
\item Mostly used in combination with cortical surface models
\end{itemize}

	

}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% THE REGULARIZATION PARAMETER


\frame{\frametitle{The regularization parameter}

Recall the MNE solution:

\[
\hat{\m}=\A^T\left(\A\A^T+\lambda\I\right)^{-1}\v
\]

Matrix $\A\A^T$ is often close to \emph(singular), i.e. hardly invertible. 

\vspace{.5cm}

The reason for this is that the leadfield matrix $\A$ is \alert{ill-conditioned}, which means that the columns of  $\A$ are not linearly independent from each other (see the lecture on fundamental linear algebra).

}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% THE LEADFIELD MATRIX IS ILL-CONDITIONED... SO WHAT?


\frame{\frametitle{The leadfield matrix is ill-conditioned... so what?}

\begin{itemize}
\item If you ignore the ill-conditioning of the leadfield, your inverse solution will be dominated by noise
\vspace{.2cm}
\item The downside is a reduction in spatial resolution

	\begin{itemize}
	\item The main cerebral generators of the EEG are synchronously activated large pyramidal cortical neurons

	\item The spatial resolution of M/EEG is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of the inverse problem

	\vspace{.2cm}
	\item Spherical head models allow for approximate analytical solutions of the forward problem (Berg's method)
